<p> As I paint Oregon from direct observation, I seek to share the wonder I experience as light and shadow play upon rarely celebrated scenery. What I find most interesting within landscape subjects is when sites show a balance between natural and human influence: when the passage of time and the growth of flora dance with the beautiful necessity of established, evolving infrastructure. Weather and decay do their work on buildings and equipment. People mend them. The grass and trees persist. In the midst of these factors, something harmonious reveals itself to me as I drive around discovering plein air sites. I am fascinated by the variations of relationships between natural and human influence, between light and shadow, and between different forms within a scene: some tense, some peaceful, some ominous, some hopeful. I enjoy emphasizing and relishing the relationships between forms much more than celebrating the forms themselves.

<p>I have been painting since early childhood and creating oil on canvas works since 2018. When I was a toddler, my mother would take me to industrial sites where I would enjoy hours of observation. As a young adult, I have worked several jobs in the skilled trades where I have been able to both apply and draw inspiration from the art that is present in industry. I am dedicated to painting from life, which, to me, means being informed by intuition, by interest, and by experiences. Painting, to me, can be a catalyst for unity. When I paint on site, I am able to form an even stronger connection to the place through conversations with passing individuals and the folks who work in the buildings I cherish. When I lead a workshop, the wonder of observation is shared and the differences of how we express our own experience are celebrated. When I paint from life, I am often reminded: art is everywhere and it is for everyone.</p>
